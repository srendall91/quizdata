# quizdata - Data design and UI design
UHI MSc Web Techologies - Web App Development module
March 2019

## Summary
A data model and preliminary user interface of a 'Quiz App' were designed as an assignment exercise for the module

## Data Design
A single file 'index.js' defines an example dataset(i.e. quizzes, questions and user's progress),
defines a number of useful functions for that dataset and runs a number of these functions returning example derived data to the console.

The data is presented as a json file also.
## User Interface Design
The folder 'html' contains a mock up of the app desgined as 'mobile first' responsive design, styled using '[bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)'
